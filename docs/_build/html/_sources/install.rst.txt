Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------
To install AMSIMP, you will need to utilise Python 3.7, or later.
Preferably, you will also want to have an installation of either
Anaconda, or Miniconda on your machine. For installation instructions,
please visit `Anaconda's documentation page`_. I strongly discourage
building from source as some of the packages needed for the installation
of AMSIMP are extremely difficult to install without the use of conda.

.. _Anaconda's documentation page: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Installing from Anaconda Cloud
------------------------------
AMSIMP is distributed on `Anaconda Cloud <https://anaconda.org/amsimp/amsimp>`_ and can be installed using conda:

.. code:: sh

   $ conda install -c amsimp amsimp

If you run into any issues, you can either create an issue on
`GitHub <https://github.com/amsimp/amsimp/issues>`_ or
contact me by `email <support@amsimp.com>`_.

Installing from Source
----------------------

Finally, you can also install AMSIMP from the source code. Again, I
strongly discourage this approach. First, clone
the repository off of GitHub:

.. code:: sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/amsimp/amsimp.git && cd amsimp

You will then need to install the software requirements, you can
do this via:

.. code:: sh

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Please note, you may have some difficulty installing some of the
software requirements, specifically Cartopy and Proj.

Finally you can install:

.. code:: sh

   $ python setup.py install
